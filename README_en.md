## About

Manga Reader is a full-stack application designed to upload, scan, and extract Japanese dialogues from manga images. Built with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend, this tool enables manga enthusiasts to digitize and analyze their favorite manga dialogues efficiently. It's particularly useful for understanding unfamiliar words or kanji characters.

## Setup Instructions

```shell
# Open a terminal and ensure Git is installed

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Smoodust/manga-reader.git
